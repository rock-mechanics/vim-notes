#!/usr/bin/bash

a[0]=1
a[1]=2
a[2]=3

echo the array is "${a[*]}"
echo there are "${#a[*]}" elements in the array

b[21]=100
b[22]=200
b[23]=300
b[24]=400
b[25]=500

echo the array is ${b[*]}
echo there are ${#b[*]} elements in the array

cat <<- _eof_

Conclusion : 
bash does not recoginise empty items in the array, only item with solid 
information is count. using \${#...} we can count the number of items in 
the list after expansion

_eof_
