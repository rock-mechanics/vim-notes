echo "let's find number with same head and tail like x5x"

echo $sample
echo $sample | sed 's/\([[:digit:]]\)[0-9]\1/!!!/'

cat <<- _eof_

back reference takes the content of the exact match in this case 
\1=0, it does not match any number

in sed, capture group is not supported by default.
so we need to escape the parenthesis

_eof_
